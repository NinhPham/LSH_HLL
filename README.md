HybridLSH search - Faster near neighbors reporting in high-dimensional space (EDBT 2017)
By integrating HyperLogLog data structures into LSH hash tables, HybridLSH can efficiently estimate the computational cost of LSH-based search 
for a given query regardless of the data distribution for reporting ALL near neighbors.
Therefore, it can choose the appropriate search strategy between LSH-based search and linear search to achieve better performance.
